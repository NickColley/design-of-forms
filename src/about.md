I bought the book from Oxfam online and noticed it was not online.

There are some interesting sections that are still relevant today, so I enjoyed seeing how something originally published in the 1940s is so relevant.

My favouites are the following:

- 1
- 2
- 3

I've tried to keep this web version as close to the book as possible as I think a lot of the appeal of it is the nerdy interesting details of that time.
