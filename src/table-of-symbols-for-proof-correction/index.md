NOTES ON THE USE OF SYMBOLS

FOR CORRECTING PROOFS

ALL corrections should be distinct and made in ink in the margins; marks made in
the text should be those indicating the place to which the correction refers.

Where several corrections occur in one line, they should be divided between the
left and right margins, the order being from left to right in both margins, and the
individual marks should be separated by a concluding mark.

![](1.jpg)

When an alteration is desired in a character, word or words, the existing character,
word or words should be struck through, and the character to be substituted written
in the margin followed by a /.

Where it is desired to change one character only to a capital letter, the word ‘cap’
should be written in the margin. Where, however, it is desired to change more than
one character, or a word or words, in a particular line to capitals, then one marginal
reference, ‘caps’, should suffice, with the appropriate symbols made in the text as
required.

Three periods or full stops (constituting an ellipsis, see No. 61) should be used to
indicate an omission, except where the preceding sentence has been concluded, in
which case four full stops should be inserted, the first of which should be close up to
the preceding word.

Normally, only matter actually to be inserted or added to the existing text should be
written on the proof. If, however, any comments or instructions are written on the
proof, they should be encircled, and preceded by the word PRINTER (in capitals and
underlined). The table begins on page 161.
