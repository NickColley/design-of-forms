For headings such as the name of the department, 10 or 12 point size is usually sufficient.
The size of type and position of the name of the department, or title of the form, should not detract the eye and attention from more important wording nearby. Generally, the title of the form should stand out more boldly than the name of the department and type should be chosen accordingly to give this effect
