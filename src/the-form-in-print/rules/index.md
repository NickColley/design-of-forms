The bodies of the specimen rules are of various sizes to work in with type. Rules
should never be used merely for underlining or stressing: bolder type, capitals, or
italic will achieve the desired result.

Original ‘copy’ and layout for this special form are shown overleaf for comparison

![IMAGE 6](https://www.fillmurray.com/g/500/506)

Original ‘copy’ for a numbered and metal-tagged form on stout paper, obviating the
writing out of a separate order, label and contractor’s charge slip and involving only the
crossing out of instructions that do not apply. The final layout is shown opposite, and the
final printed form is illustrated on page 123

An experimental form at final layout stage, designed from ‘copy’ shown opposite

![IMAGE 8](https://www.fillmurray.com/g/500/508)

This (earlier) version of a well-known application form tends to have a cluttered, rambling
and over-boxed appearance

A theoretical restyling by a typographer, purely from the typographical angle, of the form
opposite

![IMAGE 10](https://www.fillmurray.com/g/500/510)

The extensive use of capitals reduces legibility and spoils the appearance of the form.
A restyling is shown opposite

A restyling of the form shown opposite

For headings such as the name of the department, 10 or 12 point size is usually sufficient.
The size of type and position of the name of the department, or title of the form, should
not detract the eye and attention from more important wording nearby. Generally, the
title of the form should stand out more boldly than the name of the department and type
should be chosen accordingly to give this effect

Illustrating good
use of thick and
thin rules and
suitable type
(all in Gill series)

![IMAGE 13](https://www.fillmurray.com/g/500/513)

A clear and simple appearance with appropriate emphasis is obtained in these examples
with two weights of type including the heading

![IMAGE 14](https://www.fillmurray.com/g/500/514)

Letter-spaced capitals in heading and at foot. Italic for subtle emphasis

Simplicity of treatment,
using Gill Sans series

![IMAGE 16](https://www.fillmurray.com/g/500/516)

A suggested restyling, again using
Gill Sans series throughout
