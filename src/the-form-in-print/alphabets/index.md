Each type face may offer a wide choice of alphabets, e.g. capitals and lower case. The use of different alphabets can help to provide the contrast necessary
to avoid making the form look dull in appearance. A reasonable way of using the type
available is to employ Roman for the bulk of the work, Italic for instructions, and Bold
Face for emphasis—a better expedient than underlining.

Capitals should never appear in the middle of a line of lower case, nor should they
be used for continuous text, though EVEN SMALL CAPITALS may be used judiciously for
emphasis (letterspaced examples: SMALL CAPITALS SPACED THUS). Capitals
and lower case are better for long captions and matter in text because they are easier
to read than capitals in long lines. For two or more lines to be read together lower case
is always better than capitals: compare pages 126 and 127.

Small capitals may be used for occasional emphasis or minor headings, and capitals
reserved for the more important headings. However, capitals do not invariably dominate lower case. Typographers frequently reverse the traditional order by having a
main heading in large capitals and lower case, and the small heading in capitals as
on [page 112](/the-form-in-print/the-layout-of-the-printed-matter/). Much depends on the length of wording in the respective lines.

1. The original form, before redesign

2. A preliminary draft by department (not to scale). Where alterations are as extensive
as this, retyping might save time and money

3. Final draft sketch by department, ready for submission to H.M.S.O.

4. The same draft, ‘marked up’ by H.M.S.O. with instructions to printer. Typed copy
should be attached

5. The final printed form, as restyled

Specimens of type faces and their related alphabets (capitals, lower case, etc.) are given
opposite, with notes. Some type faces have ‘ranging’ numerals: 123456; others have
‘old style’ numerals: 123456

Gill Sans and Times Roman (above) are recommended, and are in very wide use. Where
Gill Sans is not available, the Metro series may be used:

If Times Roman is not available, one of the following series (Bembo, Plantin, Garamond,
Imprint, or Baskerville) would be a practicable alternative.

A good effect can be obtained with one series only, as on pages 20, 101, 123, 127, 129, 130,
131, 132 and 139. Two series (e.g. Times Roman, with Gill Bold for headings) give more
contrast. The use of more than two series would give confusion and muddle. A display
series (Rockwell or Albertus) could perhaps be used for a headline, with Times Roman
for the remainder of the form.
