    Preface
</h2>

<hr />

<p>
    <small class="upper">This</small> guide to the design and simplification
    of forms is intended for use by civil servants employed on Organisation
    and Methods and Forms Design/Control work. It may also be of interest to
    others both inside and outside the Government service.
</p>
<p>
    The guide is concerned not only with design aspects of forms in the
    popular sense but with a wide range of other office documents used in
    collecting, recording, preserving, storing, or disseminating management
    information. It does not cover departmental arrangements for controlling
    forms and stationery although attention is drawn to the fundamental
    importance of establishing the need for a form before embarking upon its
    design.
</p>
<p>
    The related subjects which, according to circumstances, may influence the
    design of forms are too many and varied to be covered effectively in a
    single book. Such matters have, therefore, been dealt with only to the
    extent necessary to lead to the development of the right attitude and
    approach to forms design, namely by outlining the more important factors
    likely to be of practical value. It is hoped that this will serve both as
    a guide to the newcomer to forms work and as an aide-mémoire to the
    experienced officer. Fuller details about various related topics can be
    found in the publications listed on <a href="" style="color: red;">page 170</a>.
</p>
<p class="mb16">
    The illustrations in this book were prepared by H.M. Stationery Office.
</p>
<p>
    NOTE: Most of the forms illustrated in this book have had to be shown in
    reduced size.
