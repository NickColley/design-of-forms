The following arrangements may help to simplify arithmetical work on documents:

(1) A form designed for vertical addition and subtraction will be easier to use than
one designed horizontally.

(2) Items to be subtracted should be arranged below the items from which they are
subtracted.

(3) Items to be added or subtracted should be arranged in adjacent entry spaces;
they should not be separated by other figures.

(4) If cross casting is necessary it will be done more easily, quickly, and with fewer ,
errors if items such as £ s. d., or tons, cwts., and lb. etc. are staggered diagonally;
(this arrangement of totals on a columnar sheet need not involve the use of extra space,
as a vertical space of $” between the horizontal lines is sufficient to provide the diagonal
pattern required, i.e. 2” in all for £ s. d.).

When it is necessary to add items in a series of similar forms the items can be
positioned at the edge of the forms enabling them to be overlapped for totalling. This
method is useful for analysis as well as summarisation; the original documents can
always be reassembled (i.e. overlapped again) for checking etc. purposes.

Mistakes are easier to correct if totals of a series of separate sheets are carried on to
a recapitulation sheet of identical ruling instead of bringing and carrying forward on
each sheet. A small number of sheets can be cut to different depths so that the totals
on each page are visible at one time and a grand total can be obtained without carrying
forward on individual sheets.

Accounting work may sometimes be facilitated by:

(1) READY RECKONERS specially designed for use with the form.

(2) CARBONISED POSTING STRIPS to provide a record of the postings made; these
strips provide a total for control purposes, and proof of posting the right amount to
the right account.

(3) ‘EXCEPTION’ OR ‘NEGATIVE’ POSTING, e.g. recording only individual
amounts not paid, or only the items to which attention must be directed.

When lines of figures are staggered, this not only facilitates totalling and cross casting but
also makes it easier to interpret and compare the statistical data for one period with another

![](2.jpg)

By staggering cash entries cross addition can be made much easier; this also reduces the
possibility of mistakes. Staggering need not take up more space on the form than that used
in the non-staggered arrangement

![](3.jpg)

Another method of staggering cash entries for easy cross addition; this method takes up
more space than the arrangement shown above but may be more suited to the general
pattern of a form

![](4.jpg)

On this form dotted diagonal lines provide another method of ‘staggering’ to facilitate
cross addition of Kilogrammes and the ‘Actual Cost of Bag’ figures at the bottom

![](5.jpg)


This arrangement of columns is less convenient for addition and subtraction than the
layout shown in the example below

![](6.jpg)

Addition of ‘Receipts’ to ‘Balance’ is made left to right, and the deduction of ‘Issues’
from ‘Balance’ is made right from left. This arrangement helps to reduce the possibility
of error; for example, by adding instead of deducting the issues

![](7.jpg)


Forms can be printed so that closing entries can be used as opening figures for the next
sheet or reverse side of the same sheet, e.g. ‘carried forward’ and “brought forward’
figures

![](8.jpg)

If ‘carry forward’ figures can be used to provide the corresponding ‘brought forward’
figures by the use of carbon, not only are time and effort saved, but the risk of error is
reduced

![](9.jpg)

This form is tumbler printed and when turned back, as in the illustration, the column
totals for the 1st and 2nd quarters on one side of the form can be aligned with the
corresponding totals for the 3rd and 4th quarters on the other side; a total for the year
can thus be obtained without writing down and carrying forward a separate sub-total for
the 1st and 2nd quarters. Spaces for the entry of temporary variations in pay are stippled

![](10.jpg)

Addition can be made easier by using masks of card or paper which conceal entries not
to be used in the calculation

![](11.jpg)

Sheets with identical rulings cut to different depths so that the totals on each are visible
for comparison and addition to a grand total

![](12.jpg)


Ready Reckoners are used as an aid to repetitive calculation, or as an alternative to the use
of a machine. Ready Reckoners often give the advantage of rounding printed figures or
answers up and down to suit practical purposes, e.g. to correspond with units of issue, and
may provide two or three answers simultaneously

![](13.jpg)

The efficient Ready Reckoner should help the hand and eye in use on a job, e.g. reference
and selection is quicker and easier when a solid mass of figures is broken up by suitable
spacing, or the use of bold type

These Daily Time Sheets for one workman are summarised weekly by overlapping the
forms so that entries in the spaces on the bottom edges make a column of figures; the
totals so obtained are entered in the shaded box of the top copy, i.e. the last Time Sheet
of the week. This dispenses with the need to create a separate list or summary of the
Daily Time Sheets. When the totals have been recorded on other pay etc. documents, the
weekly batch of Daily Time Sheets for each workman are stapled together for filing in
alphabetical order; the forms can therefore be reassembled in the overlapping position at
any time, e.g. for audit purposes

![](15.jpg)

The carbon-coated posting strip provides a simple and inexpensive proof sheet for control
purposes. Individual entries on the posting strip and separate accounting records are
made in one writing operation. The totals on the posting strip provide control figures to
prove posting both the correct amount and the correct account

![](16.jpg)

The entries on this meter card are started at the bottom instead of at the top of the form
as this facilitates calculation of the amount consumed; the previous meter reading can
thus be deducted from the latest reading in the normal way; this is easier and less subject
to error than starting at the top which would involve a deduction ‘upside-down’. The
column for the meter reading is divided by vertical dotted lines to provide a separate space
for each digit

![](17.jpg)


Forms may be overlapped by means of punched holes and a peg board. Various holding
devices can be used to keep the overlapped forms in position for totalling

![](18.jpg)

Arrangement of entry spaces and use of stippling to facilitate addition. In each period the
operations are:

(1) Add ‘Basic’ to ‘Total variations’ to give ‘New totals’. (2) Add ‘Permanent variations’
to ‘Basic’ and enter total against ‘Basic’ on the next lower set of entry spaces.
The items have been arranged so that all additions are carried out over adjoining entry
spaces, without jumping over entries. The entries which are relevant to one period only
are stippled green; those relevant from period to period are not stippled. The entries for
each period are clearly grouped by heavier lines

![](19.jpg)


Accounting work can be reduced by exception or negative posting, e.g. posting only the
‘balance’ outstanding. This ‘exception’ principle directs attention to variations from the
normal

![](20.jpg)

Tumbler printing makes it possible to fold over the top edge of a form so that the ‘carried
forward’ sub-totals on one side can be aligned above the ‘brought forward’ entry spaces
on the other side; this facilitates copying these figures for the ‘totals’ and reduces the
risk of error

This method of coded analysis uses a small sheet and provides proof of correct summarisation. The sundry payments shown are treated as follows:

(1) Classify each amount in Col. 3 by placing a code number in Col. 5; this code number
is selected from those pre-printed in Col. 8—the number in Col. 8 is crossed through when
first used to indicate the codes used. (2) Total the amounts and code numbers in Cols. 3 and
5. (3) Summarise the amounts in Col. 3 for each code and enter each total in Col. 6 on the same
line as the corresponding code number of Col. 8—a tick is placed in Col. 4 as each amount is
transferred to the summary in Col. 6. (4) Multiply each code number in Col. 5 by the number
of times it is used and enter the product in Col. 7 also on the same line as the corresponding
code number of Col. 8—the tick in Col. 4 is crossed through as each code is summarised for
Col. 7. (5) Total Cols. 6 and 7—which should agree with the totals for Cols. 3 and 5 if correct.
With a little practice this method is easy to use. The idea can be adapted to suit requirements (e.g. for a different layout, or used without pre-printed code numbers in Col. 8
when more than 25 classifications are needed). Where a wide variety of transactions occur
infrequently this method could dispense with the need for recording in several separate
books of account

![](22.jpg)

This form positions entries about change on the left edge so that all the forms can be
overlapped to provide a quick indication of the subjects needing alteration, and so that the
comments of all members can be summarised easily. The reasons for any suggested change
are placed adjacent to the coded entry so that these comments can be conveniently related
to the action suggested by members
