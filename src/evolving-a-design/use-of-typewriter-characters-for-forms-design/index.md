## Varityping

Special typewriters are manufactured which have a range of interchangeable type faces. If one of these is available a number of other typewriter characters can be introduced. Examples (from the Varityper range), with series numbers, are:

*(a) Suitable for stencil-typing or photolitho reproduction*
