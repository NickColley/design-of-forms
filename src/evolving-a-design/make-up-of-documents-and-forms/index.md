The term ‘make-up’ includes the physical arrangement of the parts or copies which
comprise one form, and the way in which a number of forms are made up into
‘packs’ or books.

MULTI-PART FORMS consist of several separate sheets; these may be folded sheets,
sheets of different size, with or without perforations and punched holes, and may be
joined and held together by folding, stapling, gumming, or stitching according to the
requirements for making entries at different stages, and the need for accurate registra-
tion for each entry (see Section entitled ‘Registration of entries by carbon’). If entries
are to be made by typewriter, stapling cannot be conveniently used and it may be
worthwhile to gum sets of forms at the top so that corrections by erasing may be made
without removing the form from the machine.

PADDED FORMS are gummed along one edge and this edge may also be taped to
give it greater strength; plasticised edging is an economical alternative method of
padding. Points to be noted are:

(1) Any of the four edges of the pad can be used as the gummed or plasticised edge.

(2) If the pad is used for hand entries, the corners of the forms are less likely to
become dog-eared if the padded edge is at the bottom of the forms.

(3) A backing board may be necessary to obtain a firm writing surface, for hand
entries, throughout the life of the pad.

(4) Forms are held in moderately good registration for entries to be made on more
than one copy with carbon paper.

(5) No binding margin is required for the padding itself although, of course, the
form may include space for a binding margin for other purposes.

(6) Padding is a convenient method of keeping unused forms in good condition,
even if they are detached before entries are made.

BOUND BOOKS OF FORMS (stapled or sewn) can provide copies to be detached and
distributed and a ‘fixed’ leaf for carbon copies of the forms to be left in the book.
Indexing pages can be provided or pages can be cut away at the edges to make an
index, so that line or column headings on one form can be read against a number of
forms. Points to note are:

(1) Perforations enable forms to be detached when the book or pad is stapled or sewn.

(2) A binding margin is necessary on all forms.

(3) The writing surface may curve near the binding margin.

(4) When the fixed leaves are used to take a carbon copy of the entries, they
need not be printed if the entries are intelligible without captions; both sides of the
fixed leaf can be used (so saving paper) by adopting one of the following two arrange-
ments—the book can be used first from front to back, and then turned over and used
from back to front; or the book can be used from front to back only and entries
made alternately on the right and left hand pages of an opening. (Two removable
sheets and a fixed sheet for opening.)

(5) Registration of copies is moderately good.
