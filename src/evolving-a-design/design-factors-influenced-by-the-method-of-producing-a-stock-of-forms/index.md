Most Government forms used on a large scale are letterpress printed, and particular
types of forms, e.g. padded forms or carbon-coated forms, will always require a
printing operation. While printing gives the clearest and neatest means of reproduction
it may not always be justified on the grounds of cost and a speedier means of repro-
duction may sometimes be required. The forms designer should be generally aware of
the other processes available and the factors which govern their suitability.

THE OFFICE TYPE OF OFFSET-LITHO MACHINE can sometimes be used for the
production of forms more cheaply and expeditiously than letterpress printing. A large
number of copies can be produced from one master and various papers can be used
including those having a surface suitable for written entries. More than one colour
may be produced on the form but each requires a separate printing operation.

Compared with letterpress printing the main disadvantages of the offset-litho pro-
cess are:

(x) Since the typewriter is the main instrument used the range of type faces and
sizes etc. is limited (this is so even if a Varityper is available).

(2) The scope for good layout is reduced.

(3) The effect of (1) and (2) is that the form tends to be larger than if printed.

(4) ‘Finishing’ operations, e.g. folding, perforations etc. cannot always be under-
taken in the reproduction unit concerned.

STENCIL METHODS. The stencil duplicator may occasionally be suitable for the
departmental production of very simple forms not used in large quantities. However,
the paper which must be used is generally heavier than is needed for printed forms,
and the range of paper sizes is limited so that there is often waste in production. ‘The
forms also tend to be larger than if printed. If semi-absorbent paper is used, the surface
is not suitable for pen and ink entries; non-absorbent duplicating ‘A’ paper may be
used if pen and ink entries are required but production of the form takes longer.

Stencils may be obtained on which the framework of the form and the major cap-
tions can be pre-cut—in type resembling printed matter. Sometimes it is quicker to
produce certain straightforward internal forms in this manner, e.g. forms which require
the periodical entry of statistical data.

TYPE-SET ROTARY DUPLICATORS can produce letterpress, but no more than six
channels of type per inch can be set up unless special blocks are made. This process is
useful for printing on cards etc. of letterheadings and the overprinting of additional
matter on a printed form.

PUNCHED HOLES may be needed for filing, sorting, selecting, or signalling purposes.
Various kinds of slotted holes can be made to enable documents to be inserted or with-
drawn from a binder or file unit etc. without removing other documents. (The
strength of the material must be determined in the light of the frequency of removal
from the binder.) When forms are to be produced on office duplicators, holes should be
punched after duplicating.

PERFORATIONS of two distinct kinds can be obtained. Machine perforation is
undertaken separately, after printing. The perforation may be slots or round holes in
various sizes. Alternatively, the form may be perforated at press. In this case the per-
forating forms part of the printing process. It is less costly than machine perforation.
It is preferable to explain to H.M. Stationery Office what requirements the perforation
must meet, since the style used may depend on production facilities.

If a choice is possible in the layout of forms with perforations they should be
arranged so that the tear-off portion of the document is along the shortest dimensions
as this will help to speed up separation.

When it is especially necessary to minimise the risk that a perforation may be torn
accidentally, it should end about 3” from the edges of the forms, but this requirement
should not be specified unless it is essential.

SCORING consists of making a crease in the paper to assist folding. Normally,
scoring can be avoided (except on thick cards) by printing folding marks.

PRINTING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FORM economises paper. However, if there is
a constant reference to instructions on the back of the form when completing entries
on the front it may be undesirable because it is inconvenient for the user and causes
errors and slows down completion of the form. When forms are printed on both sides,
any information on the document which may be referred to after filing should not be
placed in an awkward position for reference. The need to refer to both sides of a
document during sorting should be avoided.

The printing can be arranged in two ways—head-to-head, i.e. the printing is the
same way up when the form is turned over from side to side; or head-to-foot (known
as ‘tumbler’ printing), i.e. printed upside down on the back. ‘Tumbler’ printing is
generally advantageous when totals have to be carried forward from one side of the
form to a grand total on the other side, or when a figure entry on one side of the form
can be copied from the other side by turning or lifting the edge of the form; for some

jobs ‘tumbler’ printing may be the natural method of handling or turning the docu-
ments. It is useful when forms are held vertically in a tray or bound at top or bottom.

ROUNDED CORNERS instead of square corners help to keep the forms in better
condition when exceptional conditions make this rather expensive refinement desirable.
Rounded corners should be avoided for small index cards as they slow down the finger-

ing operations in searching for and selecting cards.

CUT CORNERS may also be an advantage, e.g. the bottom right hand corner can be
cut diagonally so that carbon papers protrude from the forms to enable them to be
withdrawn simultaneously by gripping and pulling the visible corners of the carbon
paper. The top right hand corner of a card may be cut diagonally to facilitate the
detection of a card missorted or wrongly filed.

Cut corners may help to detect mis-sorts or missing documents, or facilitate the extraction
of carbon papers in one pulling operation

On this combined record of Allocations, Dues In, and Stocks, the space at the top edge
can be clipped to assist selection of a particular class of cards, or coloured signal clips
can be attached at different positions. The corner is cut so that any card filed in the wrong
position, back to front, or upside down, will be detected. Coloured lines throw entries
into relief and break up the pattern

### Continuous stationery

Forms made up as continuous stationery are in common use on many types of
machines; indeed they may be essential to gain the maximum advantage from mecha-
nisation. They facilitate a continuous and rapid output from the machine: they also
save time by reducing the work involved in interleaving and extracting carbon paper.
Semi-continuous stationery in strips or perforated sheets like postage stamps may also
facilitate the handling of small documents such as receipts or gummed labels.

Single sheets, multi-part sets, labels and envelopes etc. are joined end to end, usually
with perforations between each form. The make-up of copies, and the number of
forms in each pack, can be suited to the requirements of the job, e.g. in 10s or 50s, in
flat strips of a few forms with and without carbon paper, in rolls, or in concertina folds
between each set of forms.

Continuous stationery facilitates the rapid feeding of forms into manifold registers,
typewriters, accounting machines, and addressing equipment, since the next form
can be pulled through to the printing position before the previous form is torn off.
Another advantage is that one or more copies of the form can be retained in a con-
tinuous strip, which may make the storage of such copies more secure, as well as
preserving them in the order of making out.

Strips of continuous forms can be designed for use with an ordinary typewriter and
carbon paper. Reels of documents can also be used with a standard typewriter but
continuous stationery typewriters and continuous stationery attachments for standard
typewriters are used for the preparation of sets of forms with several carbon copies.
With this kind of equipment carbon paper can be interleaved and retracted into the
sets of forms automatically, and the forms making up the set are fed to the typing
position in accurate alignment.

Manifold registers are designed to use interfold or roll type continuous stationery.
This stationery may be interleaved with one-time carbon paper or may pass between
sheets of carbon paper at the writing position. The maximum number of forms in one
set for use in a register is normally six. With some registers a security copy of the form
can be retained in a locked compartment.

Except for forms in short strips of say 2 or 3 feet, most types of continuous forms
must be printed on reels of paper on rotary presses, a method which is only econo-
nomical for long runs (say 50,000 forms or more). Printing from rotary presses
restricts the depth of the forms, but varying widths of parts can be provided so that
data can be omitted from some copies, or to suit the filing equipment etc.

When continuous forms are printed from one reel of paper, all the parts in a set are
the same quality of paper. Sets of forms made up in strips can be printed on different
grades of paper, e.g. thin paper for the top copy to facilitate carbon copying on an
under copy of more durable paper retained for reference.

Apart from the simpler kinds of strips of forms or perforated sheets of labels, pro-
duction facilities for continuous stationery are limited and it is advisable to consult
H.M. Stationery Office at an early stage.

Continuous stationery usually costs more than separate forms or padded stationery.
The additional costs must be justified by the procedural savings made.

Continuous stationery for machines can be made up in packs, with that number of forms
which suits the requirements of the job.

These forms are made up in perforated strips (6 forms per sheet) to facilitate typing. The
two forms are in register and with ordinary carbon papers enable the simultaneous
preparation of an index slip for the Inspector’s office (P203) and a copy for the Collector’s
office (P203A) which, on the reverse side, gives additional information about the reason for
issue as shown in the torn-off specimen at the bottom
