<span class="small-caps">The</span> moving of forms from point to point is generally a matter of routine which does not require the forms to be addressed. If however the form is part of a carbon set of copies for different branches, it may be desirable to include routeing instructions on the form, or a printed circulation list to save special addressing.

Paper envelopes with a string button fastener and printed lines and columns on the back and front for addressing, are convenient for internal transit purposes, since they can be re-used many times and obviate the need for gummed labels; they also prevent other loose documents from being ‘trapped’ in transit, as may happen with unsealed type of transit envelope or bag.
