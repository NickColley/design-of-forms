Envelopes are divided into two main styles—‘Banker’ envelopes, and ‘Pocket’
envelopes. The standard sizes of official envelopes are:
Banker shape Pocket shape
(inches) (inches)
33 X58 82X 53
38 X83 9 xX 4
34X49 9 X 6
4X5 98x 45
4 X6 10 xX 7
5 x74 10 xX 8
53 X83 11}X 94
14 X 9
15 xX 6

With the introduction of the new international standard sizes the banker shape
envelopes listed above will in time be replaced by the new standard sizes C7 (3}” x43"),
C6 (44” x63”) and C5/6 (42” x 88").
The measurements of an envelope are quoted in relation to the opening. Thus in
this table of envelope sizes the dimension from the top edge of the flap to the bottom
of the envelope is given first, ie. depth x width. The sizes and terms used to describe
commercial envelopes are given in British Standard 917:1949. Manufacturers’
machinery precludes the possibility of an exact standard and variations of +4” may
occur from standard size between one manufacturer and another.

Ordinary ‘stock’ envelopes should be utilised on all possible occasions; every effort
should be made to avoid demanding envelopes which bear special printings, or which
are of special sizes. In particular, when substantial quantities of envelopes will be used,
e.g. for large scale forms issue, standard sizes should be specified where possible so as
to utilise to the utmost the high speed production facilities available. Where special
supplies are essential several patterns of each kind should be forwarded with the
demand, together with an explanation as to the necessity for departure from the
standard sizes.

The smallest practicable size of envelope should be used, having regard to the time,
cost and method of folding the enclosure, and to the fact that envelopes larger than
9” x4" have to be date stamped by hand and sorted separately by the Post Office.
Large covers are inconvenient to handle in the post and covers larger than foolscap
size (3§” x 83”) should be used sparingly. :

For details of quality in the various stock sizes, e.g. Buff, Thick Buff, Glazed
Brown, Kraft, waxed paper under flap, and printing see H.M. Stationery Office List of
Paper and Office Requisites held in stock for use in the Public Service.

There are two main kinds of cut out panel envelopes which reduce addressing work
by making use of the address shown on the document inside the envelope, and which
also eliminate the possibility of putting an enclosure in the wrong envelope:

(1) ‘Window’ envelopes with a transparent panel.

(2) ‘Aperture’ envelopes with an open cut out panel; this kind is inadmissible in the
international service.

When window or aperture envelopes are used the enclosure has to be folded with
care to make sure that the address is visible. If it is to remain visible it is necessary to
fold so that the depth of the folded form is approximately equal to the depth of the
envelope. Before using this type of envelope it is desirable to make a thorough test
because the extra care required in folding and enveloping can offset the saving in time
over the use of a pre-addressed envelope.

The use of the window envelopes with a transparent panel should be restricted to
cases where privacy of the contents is essential. Window envelopes can be re-used with
economy labels. Aperture envelopes are not normally re-usable. The range of sizes of
these types of envelopes is limited and H.M. Stationery Office should be consulted
about availability in the early stages of designing the form as an enclosure. Aperture
envelopes for use with payable orders are stocked by H.M. Stationery Office (size
38" X53” Ajcs. Gen. 15a).

All correspondence must be made up to Post Office requirements about addresses,
size, weight, colour and printing etc. Particular care should be taken to observe the
special restrictions applied by the Post Office to window and aperture envelopes set
out in the current edition of the Post Office Guide, and Post Office Leaflet P.2351.H.

from which the following details are taken.
A packet enclosed in a window envelope must conform to the following conditions:

(1) The panel must extend parallel to the length of the envelope.

(2) A space of 1} inches must be left above the panel for the postage stamp and
the date-stamp impression.

(3) No writing or printing other than the address may be displayed through the
panel and the address must appear through the panel in such a manner as to be read
with reasonable facility.

(4) The enclosures must be so folded that they cannot move about in the envelope,
and thus cause the address to be hidden.

A packet enclosed in an ‘aperture’ envelope (an envelope with an open panel) must
conform to the following conditions:

(1) The open (cut-out) panel must not exceed 33” in length by 1}” in width.

(2) The requirements shown in (r), (2), (3), (4), in the preceding paragraph con-
cerning transparent panels.

(3) A minimum space of at least half an inch must be left within the sides and base
of the cut-out panel and the respective edges of the envelopes.

Entirely transparent envelopes, and envelopes likely to ‘trap’ other postal items are
forbidden.

Envelopes in the form of continous stationery can be obtained for use with machines
fitted with sprocket feed attachments.

ECONOMY LABELS of the following sizes are stocked by H.M. Stationery Office:

* These larger sizes may be used as wrappers for circulars and correspondence of a non-
permanent character without the use of envelopes.
It may sometimes be necessary to consider certain features of mail handling
equipment:
(1) ENVELOPE OPENING MACHINES: the size of the document and envelope
should permit the contents of the envelope to be shaken down below the depth of the
cutting edge, to avoid mutilation of the contents.

A form to requisition typing work can save time by providing complete information about
how the work is to be done; without it, time may be wasted in finding the customer’s
number in the telephone book to obtain instructions. An alternative is a two-way folder
to convey typing work to and from the customers, and to provide all the details required
by the typing staff. The address of the customer and typing pool need be written once
only during the life of the folder. Where several typing pools or customer branches are
involved, a different coloured folder could be used for each one. Punched holes to
indicate when empty would add to the usefulness of this internal transit document
(2) FOLDING MACHINES: these machines can make a variety of folds, ranging from
the single-fold to the more complicated accordion folds. Folding is so accurate that it
facilitates the tuck-in of documents designed as postal folders, or the correct placing
of the address when the document is despatched in a window envelope. A range of
paper sizes, normally up to 12” x 19", can be passed through the machine.

(3) WRAPPING MACHINES for magazines, catalogues and periodicals up to about
14” X12” which can be rolled in wrappers up to 12” 14".

(4) ENVELOPE INSERTING AND SEALING MACHINES which can take document
sizes from 4" x 4” to 84” x 13” and envelopes up to 9” x4”.

This window envelope is designed with a front flap on which the ‘ Official Paid’ design is
printed in addition to being printed in the normal position on the front of the envelope
itself. ‘The flap is tucked inside to send out the blank form; when completed the form is
confidential and is returned by sealing the gummed flap on the outside. After this ‘two
way’ use the envelope can be further used with an economy label.

The size of documents should be fixed in relation to the size of the standard envelope used
so that folding is minimised; small additional folds such as those shown in this diagram
(shaded portion) waste time and can be avoided
