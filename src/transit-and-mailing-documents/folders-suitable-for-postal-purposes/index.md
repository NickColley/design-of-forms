Postal folders, cards and labels can be designed for ‘two-way’ use. Forms designed as a postal folder not only eliminate a covering letter, but also cut out the cost and work involved in using envelopes; they are particularly suitable when the information transmitted is not confidential, and when the folder makes it easier for the recipient to deal with the reply in this way.

Folding marks and folding instructions on the form should be printed where they can be seen while the form is being folded. It is better to print marks with which the edges of the form should be aligned, than lines to mark the place where the fold should be made. In particular, lines printed on the inside of the fold should be avoided.

It is important to note that Post Office rules require that the folded or closed end of the postal folder must be the same end as that to which the postage stamp or ‘Official Paid’ design is attached; it is this end of the folder which first passes through the stamp cancelling machine and this layout helps to reduce the possibility of damage or difficulty during this machine process. Flimsy or dark paper is unsuitable for postal purposes.

For postal folders there are several alternative designs available; those shown following form part of the Post Office leaflet ‘Folders Suitable for Postal Purposes’ (HQ 72/58) the content of which is as follows:
The use of folders for postal purposes is, in general deprecated by the Post Office, as folders tend to be more difficult to handle than envelopes or cards. For example, they are liable to damage in stamp-cancelling machines, or to be torn as they pass through a machine, causing a jam which involves stopping the machine and so delaying the work. Again, at the sorting stage, they may cause delay through other communications catching in the open ends.

It is realised, however, that many posters find folders very convenient and objection will not be raised to their use provided that they are made up on the lines indicated in the diagrams in this leaflet and that the following requirements are observed:

1. Limits of size: Minimum 4&Prime; &times; 2&frac34;&Prime;
, Maximum 6&Prime; &times; 3&frac12;&Prime;<br/>
NOTE: The minimum dimensions quoted apply to envelopes and cards generally. It is often found that folders designed to fold to these dimensions are, owing to faulty printing or folding, below the minimum size. Moreover, after adequate space has been left for the postage stamp and date-stamp impression (see (2)) the minimum depth of 23&Prime; leaves little room for the address. It is therefore recommended that the minimum size should be taken as 4&Prime; &times; 3&Prime;.
2. A space of at least 1&frac12;&Prime; for date-stamp impressions must be left above the address.
3. Any printing on the address side, other than the address, must be confined to the left-hand half of that side.
4. Stout paper should be used. White paper is preferable, but there is no objection to the use of pale shades of buff, yellow, green or blue. It is essential, however, that the ink used on coloured paper should be in sharp contrast with the tint of the paper. Printing in red ink is objectionable.
5. Wire clips, staples or stitches should not be used to secure folders.

NOTE: Packets intended for transmission at the Printed Paper rate must comply with the regulations of that rate. (See Post Office Guide, or leaflet P386, obtainable at any Head Post Office.)

5. Reply folder: alternative layout

NOTE: When it is necessary to type both addresses on a reply folder (see No. 4) before despatch, it is not possible to design a layout which avoids taking the folders out of the machine to type the second address, since the closed end of the folder must be the same end as that to which the postage stamp or ‘Official Paid’ design is attached.
