### Translucent paper and dyeline copying

It may sometimes be economical to print the stock of blank forms on paper which is
translucent to ultra violet light so that it becomes possible to obtain a number of copies
of the form (as completed after use) by the dyeline process.

This method has advantages when:

1. It is not practicable to obtain the desired number of completed copies when the
original entries are made, e.g. when a document is completed by a member of the
public and it is unreasonable to expect more than one copy or because it is not practicable to obtain all the copies required by more conventional means such as carbon

2. the number of copies required varies according to circumstances

3. it is necessary to take copies of the entries on documents periodically, and when
the quantity or nature of the entries on those documents varies on each occasion. For
example, a ledger sheet printed on translucent paper becomes the ‘master’; the
account can then be compiled, day by day, by handwritten or typed entries and
whenever necessary, e.g. at the end of an accounting period, the ledger sheet can be
totalled and the appropriate number of copies produced by the dyeline process to
serve as an invoice or statement of account.

If translucent masters are to be prepared in manuscript, the use of a carbon black
ink is important, since ordinary writing inks seldom give a sufficiently dense image.
The use of pencil or ball pen should be avoided; if pencil must be used a soft degree
should be selected. There are several kinds of translucent paper available, ranging
from a high grade bond paper which has the appearance of an ordinary typewriting
paper, to certain types of tracing paper which are much faster printing, but are not
particularly attractive in appearance. The advice of H.M. Stationery Office should be
sought as to the most suitable grade for the work in mind.

### Note

Diazo (dyeline) paper is coated with an emulsion which is sensitive to ultra-violet
light; when exposed this emulsion becomes inactive, but the parts which have been
protected by the dark lines on the translucent master will, by the application of certain
chemicals or ammonia gas, form a dye image. For this reason the copy is often called
a ‘dyeline print’. The paper can be handled in any room lighting so that no dark room
etc. is needed and the equipment is designed for use on an office desk.

PHOTOCOPYING and other reproduction methods may sometimes be employed to
obtain copies of forms and entries thereon.

Requests for a laboratory report are written on this form (printed on translucent paper)
by the doctor; it is then passed to the laboratory where results of the tests are then added
after different intervals of time; at each stage when a report is entered, dyeline copies of
the whole document are made and passed back to the doctor as an up-to-date report for
retention in the case history file; the original being retained and entries thereon made (in
manuscript) by the laboratory staff until all the necessary reports are complete. Note the
abbreviated captions and coded entries to save space and writing
