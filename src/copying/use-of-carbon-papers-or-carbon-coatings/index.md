THE method to be adopted for making such copies of the form as are required in use
must be carefully considered since it may substantially affect certain aspects of its
design. The methods principally used are described below.

USE OF CARBON PAPERS OR CARBON COATINGS

## Carbon papers

Various grades of paper and carbon paper, suitable for different methods of entry
and yielding different numbers of copies are obtainable. For good results it is important to ensure that the right kind of carbon paper is used with a suitable paper, both
when trying out new ideas and for the finished forms. Slight differences in the performance of carbon papers may occur from time to time, and it may be necessary to
make some allowance for these unavoidable manufacturing variations. When necessary
H.M. Stationery Office should be consulted on special technical points about the
matching of suitable papers for copying purposes.

The main groups into which carbon papers can be divided are:

1. Pencil carbons, one or two-sided

2. Pen carbons

3. Typewriter carbons

4. Hectographic and spirit duplicator carbons

5. One-time carbons, either as separate sheets, or as carbonised forms; these are
used for handwriting and for typewriting etc.

Carbon papers in Groups (1)-(4) above are stocked by H.M. Stationery Office, but
any requirements in Group (5) are purchased specially. Two-sided typewriter carbons,
carbons of special high quality, carbons for use with addressing plates, and supplies
such as paper-edged carbon to facilitate handling and insertion in sets of forms, also
need to be specially purchased for departments.

COLOURED CARBONS are obtainable as follows, but the colours shown in brackets
are not normally stocked by H.M. Stationery Office:

Pencil carbons: black, blue (purple, red, green)

Pen carbons: blue (black)

Typewriter carbons: black (blue, red, yellow, green)

Hectograph and spirit duplicator carbons: purple, red, green, black (blue, brown)
Black carbons with a red strip for use on accounting documents are also obtainable,
but cost more than one-colour carbons and need to be specially purchased.

For writing and typewriting the colours black purple and blue give the best
legibility on white or buff paper. Black should be absolutely permanent; blue and
purple are reasonably resistant to fading; but the green and red, although retaining
their colour for a considerable time, will eventually fade, and are not therefore suitable
when permanency is an essential feature.

For hectograph and spirit duplicators, the colour normally used is purple on account
of the high tinctorial strength of the dye used; of the other colours available none is at
present equal to purple in depth, but improvements are continually being made.

PENCIL CARBONS are designed for use with a fairly hard pencil, and it is advisable
to use a backing sheet of card or metal if more than one carbon copy is to be taken.

TWO-SIDED PENCIL CARBONS are designed for use with manifold books or sets—
when the top or second copy is on tissue or translucent paper, the carbon entry on the
back of the tissue paper being read through this paper; thus one sheet of two-sided
carbon paper can be used to produce three copies (a top copy, the tissue copy, and a
copy underneath the two-sided carbon). In another application of this type of carbon
the impression on both sides of a sheet makes alteration or falsification more difficult.
Two-sided carbon paper is about 25% more expensive than one-sided carbon and the
latter is preferable unless the copying methods offer a compensating saving by the use
of two-sided carbon and tissue paper.

PEN CARBONS are more sensitive than pencil carbons, and a backing sheet or plate
is generally necessary. Sensitive carbons reproduce pressure marks upon the top copy
with fingers as dirty marks on the carbon copies, but such blemishes can be avoided.

Ball pens are the most efficient writing instruments for use with either pencil or
pen carbons but their use also involves more rapid exhaustion of the carbon paper.
For pen carbons, specially hard manifolding pens are available; ‘S.O. No. 12 Manifold
Pen’ (Code No. 50-66) is the most suitable for producing copies from pen carbons.

TYPEWRITER CARBONS are stocked by H.M. Stationery Office, in two weights but
only one colour (black), as follows:

1. Light, which will give up to 8 copies at one time on normal weights of paper.

2. Extra light, which will give up to 15 copies at one time on thin paper.

The number of carbon copies obtainable with a typewriter will depend on:

1. The weight and quality of the stationery used.

2. The make, age, state of repair and cleanliness of the machine used.

3. The hardness and condition of the typewriter platen.

4. The touch of the operator.

There is a limit to the total thickness of paper which may be passed into a typewriter
and good copies cannot be produced if too many sheets of paper are used.

A more sensitive carbon paper will be needed for machines with a softer stroke. The
number of carbon copies, obtainable therefore varies up to about eight copies with an
ordinary typewriter, to perhaps 20 with an electric typewriter. Carbon copies can be
made through cards on an Underwood Elliot Fisher flat-bed machine.

Office for departments.
qualities it is necessary to experiment with various papers, carbons and platens to
obtain optimum results.

ONE-TIME CARBONS. A very thin and lightly-coated sheet of carbon paper may
be interleaved with sets of forms (whether used in pad form or with a machine).
Coloured one-time carbon paper is available. For the same number of operations
one-time carbon paper costs more than ordinary carbon paper and the question is
whether the extra costs are justified by increased output.

NO CARBON REQUIRED (NCR) PAPER is chemically treated to produce copies
without interleaving carbon sheets. It is dearer than comparable quality paper plus
carbon: so much so that, for very large quantities, carbon bonding or patching may be
cheaper. Patch coated NCR paper is not yet available although small areas can be
desensitised by the printer. Six good copies can be obtained with a ball pen, but a
hard writing surface is required. Up to eight copies can be obtained with a standard
typewriter, and twelve or more copies with an electric typewriter. Copies are as good
as those produced by blue carbon. The coating is sensitive and subject to accidental
pressure marks. Errors cannot be corrected by erasure. NCR paper can be used for
Continuous Stationery. Three kinds are made—for top, intermediate and bottom
copies respectively.

### Carbon coating

The carbon-coated type of form can be used when ordinary carbon paper is not
suitable for making manifold entries, for example when it is necessary to avoid interleaving with separate sheets of carbon paper or when certain entries only are required.

Production facilities for carbon-coated forms are limited because only a few manufacturers undertake this work. They are about two-thirds more costly than forms used
with ordinary carbon even when relatively large quantities are ordered. For smaller
quantities, i.e. 50,000, the cost may be as much as three times the cost of an ordinary
form. Accordingly H.M. Stationery Office normally require evidence of savings in
staff time etc. gained by using this kind of stationery in preference to ordinary forms
and carbon paper. Small quantities can sometimes be obtained for a trial run.

The carbon coating can be applied either as part of the printing process, when it
resembles printing ink, or as a separate operation, when it gives a coating similar to
that used for normal one-time carbons. The latter gives by far the better impression,
and is generally preferred because the ‘printed’ variety is liable to dry out and become
ineffective after comparatively short storage.

Coloured coatings are available; blue and purple are satisfactory, but red and green
may be fugitive in strong light.

The carbon coating can be laid on the form in two ways:

IN BANDS in which the carbon coating is flowed on to the paper in continuous
bands along the whole length of the reel of paper. Bands can be varied in width and
position, the reel being cut subsequently into separate sheets on which the bands of
carbon run from edge to edge. Band carbonised forms are usually printed after
carbonising.

IN PATCHES: with this process the carbon coating is ‘printed’ from special blocks
of the required size or shape using liquid carbon coating instead of printer’s ink. The
face sides of the forms are usually printed prior to carbonising.

A four-part set of forms with carbon patches on the first three. There are no carbon
patches under the entries ‘Prepared by’ and ‘Checked by’ on the smaller top file copy,
so that these spaces can be used for other purposes on the third and fourth copies. A
different arrangement of carbon patches on the back of the third copy excludes certain
details from the fourth copy. Punched holes are provided at both ends of the copies so
that a file copy can be folded in half to prevent the carbon coating smearing other documents
in the file


The edges of the coating must register with the entry spaces on the face of the form.

Patch coating is more expensive than band coating; and the production facilities for
patch coating are even more limited than those for band coating. For these reasons
patch carbonising should be avoided as much as possible, by designing the form in
such a way that bands of carbon coating pass under the appropriate entry spaces; if by
this method the carbon coating extends under entries which should not appear on the
copies of the form, it may be practical to obscure the unwanted carbon entries on the
copies by printers’ ornaments, or heavy black shading.

The main advantages of carbon-coated forms are:

1. Greater convenience in handling.

2. Selective copying is possible thus freeing space on the under-copy or enabling
the size to be reduced.

The main disadvantages of carbon-coated forms are their greater cost and limited
production facilities. Other less important disadvantages include:

1. The paper used is limited to that suitable for carbon coating.

2. Some recipients of forms do not like carbon coating. The carbon coating may
rub off and soil the hands, or adjacent papers in files.

3. The carbon coating tends to soak through the paper, darkening the writing
surface, and reducing the legibility of pencil entries on the carbon-coated form.

4. Alteration and correction can be made only by crossing out and re-writing.

5. Carbon-coated forms are not good salvage.

In view of the difficulties associated with the supply of carbon-coated forms, early
consultation with H.M. Stationery Office is advisable, after other and possibly more
economical methods of making copies of entries have been studied.

### Registration of entries made by carbon

When entries are made simultaneously on more than one copy of the form (e.g. a
four part carbon set), some inaccuracy in registration may be caused by the bulk of
carbon interleaved between sheets, or by a typewriter platen slipping. If tolerance is
not allowed in fixing the size of the entry spaces, entries on the under copies may
encroach on printed lines or even on adjoining entry spaces.

The accuracy of registration depends partly on the device used to hold the forms
together during the entry process. Registration is usually more difficult to maintain
with large forms unless special devices are used.

The following methods may be used to facilitate registration:

1. Providing deeper or larger entry spaces on the under copies or dispensing with
lines and boxes for some parts of the form.

2. Ruling heavy lines to help the eye when aligning forms of different size.

3. Stapling or padding sets of forms.

4. Using holding devices such as peg boards, or a folded card, to align and hold
documents in position during the writing of entries. (The registration and the feed of
multi-part forms used in some accounting machines, teleprinters, or with hand
registers, can be controlled by sprocket devices engaging in a series of holes punched
in the margins of the form.)

![Good alt text lol]({{ page.url }}2.jpg)

This six-part set of forms is made up in pads for preparation with ordinary carbon paper. The
purpose of each copy is shown at the top, and a corner is numbered. Apart from this, each copy
has identical printing in black ink on different coloured paper. The set is prepared by the
Consignor before sending his surplus goods to a Clearing Depot for reissue or sale etc. Copy
No. 6 is kept for control purposes by the Consignor who sends the other five copies to the
Clearing Depot. Copy No. 1 becomes a posting medium after use by the Storekeeper and the
Assistant Superintendent of the depot, Copy No. 2 is kept by the Storekeeper. Copies No. 3
and 4 are used as depot control documents before use as a Consignor’s Receipt and Accounts
Division copy. Copy No. 5 serves as an Advice to the Consignor that the depot can accept the
goods and as an advice to the Removal Contractor. The introduction of this form eliminated
the copying work involved in maintaining several separate records, and also improved control
by using original documents to serve different purposes at various stages without creating fresh
records

A form folded, perforated and stapled to facilitate registration of entries on copies serving
as an application, an import licence and two copies of the licence produced with carbon
paper

![Good alt text lol]({{ page.url }}4.jpg)

For ‘two-in-one’ writing operations on forms of different size, simple and inexpensive
devices which do not require punched holes can be used to keep two forms in registration.
In this example a cheque and cheque register are prepared in one operation with ordinary
carbon paper, the sheets being held in registration by means of a manilla backing card,
the left edge of which is folded to make a flap over the left-hand margins of the two forms;
printed lines on the flap and in the middle of the cheque register enable each cheque to be
positioned correctly and easily on the next line of entry on the cheque register

![Good alt text lol]({{ page.url }}5.jpg)


Semi-continuous forms can be supplied in perforated strips (4 forms per sheet) to facilitate preparation, by typewriter, of returns of certain payments. After separation the slips
are used as unit documents for assembling particulars of the earnings of the individual
recipients. Similar type forms can be produced as continuous stationery with sprocket
holes for use in accounting machines

![Good alt text lol]({{ page.url }}6.jpg)

A deep entry space on the under copy and a thick printed line facilitate registration for
carbon copying

![Good alt text lol]({{ page.url }}7.jpg)

A peg board simplifies the handling and positioning of forms for a ‘three-in-one’ writing
operation with carbon paper, when it is necessary for three forms of different size and shape
to be kept in accurate registration
